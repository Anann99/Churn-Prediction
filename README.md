# Churn Analysis and Prediction Project

This project aims to analyze and predict customer churn for a telco service provider using the dataset from the [Churn Prediction 2020 competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/churn-prediction-practice-problem). The project has been divided into various steps :
- Data Analysis, visualisation (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Development 

## Requirements

The following packages are required to run the code in this project:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

## Data

The dataset used in this project is the Telco Service Provider dataset from the Churn Prediction 2020 competition. The data includes information such as customer demographic information, services used, and billing information.

## Analysis

The analysis part of the project focuses on understanding the relationship between various features and customer churn. The data is first cleaned and preprocessed, followed by exploratory data analysis using visualizations created with matplotlib and seaborn.

## Prediction

For the prediction part of the project, a Random Forest classifier is used to build the model. The model is trained and tested on the data to predict whether a customer will churn or not.

## Conclusion

The project provides insights into customer churn and the factors that contribute to it. The final model built can be used by the telco service provider to predict customer churn and take necessary actions to retain customers.

## How to run the code

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/churn-analysis-and-prediction.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd churn-analysis-and-prediction`
3. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run the python notebook: `python notebook`

## Note

The code and analysis in this project are for educational purposes only and not intended to be used in a real-world scenario.
